Hi I’m India, an entry level software engineer who has experience with website and app development. I am a lover of both backend and front end development. I’m working towards my goal of being a great full stack developer. For the past 4 months, I have been working with Tuck Software Group as their software engineer intern developing a website using React.js, CSS, and Javascript programming languages. I’m currently on the hunt for a new position as an intern or entry level position. I have had hands on experience in all stages of the software development cycle, from design to testing and deployment. Some of my tasks have been altering code, fixing bugs, brainstorming ideas or integrating new systems.
Something that I love about software development is the opportunity to work with people with a wide range of skills and knowledge. The software development lifecycle involves working with so many different people and departments and, as a person who loves to learn and someone who loves to build new relationships, it’s great to be able to come together with other professionals who are striving towards the same goal. I’m passionate about software development and I’m looking forward to getting to work on new projects in the near future.
